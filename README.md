This project was done by me and user Priontyyy, here's the profile to her link https://github.com/Priontyyy
This is just me giving credit where its due. She is not a responsible collaborator, that's for sure.

I removed her as a collaborator since all she did is design the index, login and signup page.
Since the beginning, I alone designed the EER diagram and Schema. She didn't even ask to collaborate as a group member.
Based on her work, I, myself had to design other pages and implement each and every feature for the website.

Apparently, she's sick most of the time, which isn't inherently an issue but she's very unresponsive.
I dmed her two days ago to write the lab report but she didn't even bother to respond.

I legitimately don't care how bad this makes me look. I definitely would've used harsher language but I have to keep this formal. I am also blocking her.
